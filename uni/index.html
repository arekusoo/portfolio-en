    <p>
      A digital device that supports adolescents with MDD (Major Depressive Disorder), combined with the concept
      of emotional design, aims to encourage users to engage in cognitive activities and social interactions. It was developed during my undergraduate program and resulted in the production of a research article.
    </p>

    <p class="title1">Introduction</p>

    <p>Among depression cases in society, those occurring during adolescence are more frequent due to the biological, psychological, and social changes adolescents go through. This project focuses on a study that proposes the development of a digital device to mitigate the effects of mild MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) in adolescents, seeking social reintegration and prevention of worsening symptoms through the use of Human-Computer Interaction principles and Affective Ergonomics.</p>

    <h3><br>1. Immersion</h3>

    <p>During the preliminary Immersion stage, bibliographic and documentary research was conducted
      in order to build a theoretical foundation based on expert authors in the field. From the in-depth Immersion phase, the key agents
      involved in the life of an adolescent with mild MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) were identified, and based on that,
      research procedures were applied. <br><br>
      
      Using the netnography technique, a structured questionnaire was specifically applied to ten adolescents
      diagnosed with mild MDD to map post-crisis effects (short, medium,
      long term, from the perspective of the individual, family, professionals, and friends) and habits related to the
      use of digital interactive devices. </p>

      <img src="../public/form uni.png" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 16px;">
      <p class="subt">Example of the applied form</p>

      <p>Later, with a focus group of three adolescents of different ages, topics such as interpersonal relationship level
      (family members, classmates, friends, best friends, romantic partners, and strangers) were discussed, and
      the themes related to the origin of the condition in each patient and its effects were reinforced. Structured interviews
      were also conducted with two groups defined as relevant factors in adolescents' lives.
      A structured interview with three professionals in psychology and psychiatry was conducted
      to gather data on alternative treatments, recommendations commonly made after diagnosis,
      and factors that aggravate the disorder. <br><br>
      
      Finally, a structured interview was conducted with the general public (around 30 people,
      including family and non-family members of adolescents with depression),
      in order to collect insights from the public perspective on depressive disorder and their level of knowledge about the topic.</p>
      
      <p class="title1">Data Analysis</p>

      <p>As a result of the online questionnaire with adolescents, it was possible to understand that:</p>

      <p>As a result of the interview with the general public, it was possible to understand that:</p>

      <img src="../public/analisys2.png" style="width: 100%;">

      <p class="title1">Focus Group</p>

      <p>From the focus group, it was possible to understand that the origins of the reported disorders stem from different factors, namely: bullying, family aggression,
        and romantic relationships. It is clear that all participants showed abrupt behavioral changes
        after the events, and through diagnosis it was possible to define what should be
        done as treatment. All were diagnosed with mild MDD, but only one
        remained in treatment; the others were not interested because they did not want to “worry
        their families.” <br><br>
      
        All participants showed low self-esteem and eating disorders, and did not feel
          satisfied with their own bodies due to the disorder. It was reported that this condition, in addition to being
          recurrent and inactive, cannot be predicted, as there is no specific trigger for
          a melancholic state. Therefore, adolescents are prone to feel the effects of depression
          at any moment. In two of the three cases, there were frequent thoughts related to suicide,
          resulting from dissatisfaction with their feelings and lack of interest in daily
          activities; however, no suicide attempts were reported. </p>



      <h3><br>2. Creation</h3>

      <p>Aiming to implement a digital device as
        the project solution, usability and emotional ergonomics concepts were applied in its
        design, and a framework of design attributes was defined, since they address
        self-fulfillment needs. Through brainstorming combined
        with the synthesis of data generated in the immersion stages and co-creation with
        adolescents with depressive disorder, it was possible to generate alternatives for the theme. Then, using
        insight cards, generated ideas were filtered and possible solutions were
        organized by specific categories, and finally combined with guiding criteria. <br><br>With the
        help of a positioning matrix, it was possible to analyze the best alternatives to
        develop for each persona and create a prototype. The criteria established for the
        project are those that provide the focus envisioned at the beginning of
        its development. Through them, it becomes visible which factors carry greater weight and what needs to be
        solved. The term persona refers to the use of fictional characters that present
        the same behavior patterns as the main people involved in the problem. In this
        project, three different personas were used: one representing an adolescent with MDD, another
        representing a family member (the father), and the other a person from the social circle (a friend).</p>

        <p class="title1">Identity</p>

        <p>Its interface should provide, through the use of rounded shapes,
          a welcoming experience, together with light and soft color tones, thus creating
          a simple and affectionate visual style.</p>

        <p class="subt">Uni Logo</p>

        <p class="title1">Solution Features</p>

        <p>At this stage, solutions were created according to adolescents' needs. Below is the list of identified general features: <br><br>
        - Socialize;<br>
        - Encourage physical activity;
        - Interact with the user;
        - Monitor the user;</p>

        
        
      <h3><br>3. Prototyping</h3>

      <p class="title1">Socialize</p>

        <p>To encourage user engagement with the device, it is possible to use points
          earned through usage to exchange for skins that can be used by the character.</p>

          <div class="image">
            <img src="../public/skins.png" class="logoresize">
    
          </div>

          <p class="subt">Skins designed for the character</p>
          
        <p class="title1">Encouragement of Activity Practice</p>

        <p>Using the “Fitness” menu, the device will present features to the user
          such as “Walk,” “Meditate,” “Jumping Jacks,” etc. There will be random moments when the
          user will receive suggestions at alternating times, with phrases from the character such as: “How about
          taking care of your skin today?”. These suggestions can be accepted; however, because they are not monitored
          by the character, they will not result in large amounts of friendship points.</p>

          <div class="image">
            <img src="../public/ativida.png" class="logoresize">
    
          </div>
          <p class="subt">Example of the "Walk" feature</p>



          <p class="title1">Interact with the user</p>

          <p>The device character will respond to user voice commands through
            expressions similar to emojis, since these are commonly used among the
            target audience. It will also allow users to accumulate points and use them to unlock
            new appearances for the character.</p>
