    <p>
      This project is defined as a tutoring system for students, tutors, coordinators, and professors. Its goal is to provide an online platform to facilitate communication and tracking of tutoring activities in an educational institution. Below are the stages carried out during the project development. The project goals were defined through a direct briefing with the client, who requested that the project be developed as a digital platform. I participated in this project as a UI/UX Designer and also defined branding concepts.
    </p>

    <div class="hint">
      <p class="obj"><strong>Goal 1:</strong> Understand the roles involved and each role’s needs.</p>
      <p class="obj"><strong>Goal 2:</strong> Develop a digital system that supports each role according to its needs.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The following 5 stages were used to develop the project.</p>

    <h3><br>1. Understand</h3>
    <p>In the first stage, we built an understanding of the project and its users. With the help of a CSD Matrix, it was possible to guide participants and align expectations for the final product. In addition, we mapped the main questions related to the project and users.</p>
    <img src="../public/matriz_super.png" width="100%">
    <p>Based on the questions and assumptions raised in the matrix, the following questions aligned with the goals:<br>
      - Why is a digital platform needed?<br>
      - How is tutoring currently handled, and what is the impact of a digital platform?<br>
      - Who is the system’s target audience? What are the needs of everyone involved?<br><br>
    
    To answer these questions, we applied a form to: <br>
    Students, to understand their difficulties with the current tutoring booking format.<br>
    Tutors, with a similar objective to the student group.<br>
    Professors, to understand how they manage tutoring activities.<br><br>
    
    In addition to the form, we conducted a benchmark study supported by a SWOT analysis of products to understand how other institutions handle this problem and how booking is done. The products studied included: Toolzz Mentor, Mentor Cruise, and Trello.<br>
      The system’s main client is the coordinator, so an interview was conducted to map their needs for the system.</p>
    
    <h3><br>2. Analyze</h3>

    <p class="title2">Form Results</p>
    <p>To capture user interest, a semi-structured form (with closed and open questions) was used, allowing us to understand how many people were interested in the platform. We also captured how people felt about the proposed idea and how it would impact their daily lives. As a result of the interviews, we found that:</p>

        <p>Após os dados analisados, foi possível mapear requisitos de usabilidade para o sistema, onde esses foram pontos de partida para a interface a ser desenvolvida.</p>

        <p class="title2">Usability Requirements</p>

        <div class="card">
          <img src="../public/smile.png" class="cuteicon">
          <p>
            <strong>Ease of use:</strong> the system should be easy to use and navigate, with a clear and intuitive layout that allows users to perform actions quickly and efficiently.

        </div>
      
        <h3><br>3. Create</h3>
        <p>After a short brainstorming session, we were able to define the brand name to be applied to the system and its style. One requirement was to include the colors present in the university brand where the system would be presented. Therefore, green and graphite gray tones complement each other in the brand’s visual identity.</p>

        <img src="../public/painel.png" style="width: 100%;">

        <p>With the support of a mood board, it was possible to find references that matched the style defined during brainstorming. After that, elements such as colors, applications, and typography were chosen to build a cohesive identity.</p>

        <p class="title2">Visual Identity</p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="../public/superlogo.png" class="logoresize">

        </div>

        <p>The concept presents a symbol that resembles an “S,” and ambiguously also represents a lightning shape. This reinforces the word “super,” which refers to the heroes represented in the product.
          The sans-serif typography used in the brand features circular forms supported by rectangular structures, giving it a more modern character. Lowercase letters were used to create a cohesive visual form alongside the main symbol.</p>

        <img src="../public/cor.png" style="width: 100%">
        

        <p>The colors reinforce the context in which it was conceived: IComp (UFAM), which traditionally uses green tones strongly associated with the Amazon and regional flora. With this in mind, yellow gradient tones were adapted over green to reinforce the brand’s modernity and dynamism.</p>

        <img src="../public/tipografia.png" style="width: 100%;">

        <p>As a supporting font across various materials, the Inter family is used, presenting a concept similar to the brand proposal. Its differential lies in a rectangular structure that helps build complementary texts without overshadowing the brand itself.</p>

        <img src="../public/super.png" style="width: 100%;border-radius: 24px;">

        <p>In the final application, rounded elements similar to those in the brand were used. Their inverted arrangement directs the eye toward the center and creates a sense of movement together with the central element. The element colors follow those already present in the brand, reinforcing its concept and style.</p>

        <p class="title2">Sitemap and User Flows</p>

        <p>Along with developing the visual identity, we were able to create the system’s first flows. With the help of a simplified sitemap, we gained a broad view of system functions and how interactions between them would occur.</p>
        
        <img src="../public/aluno.png" style="width: 100%;">
        <img src="../public/monitor.png" style="width: 100%;">
        <img src="../public/professor.png" style="width: 100%;">
        <img src="../public/coordenador.png" style="width: 100%;">

        <p>Some user action flows were structured, making it possible to map error screens, define components, and determine how the email system should be applied.</p>

        <img src="../public/fluxos.png" style="width: 100%;">

        <h3><br>4. Prototype</h3>

        <img src="../public/wireframe.png" style="width: 100%;">

        <p>Após a construção dos fluxos foi possível iniciar a criação das telas em protótipos de baixa fidelidade. Acima estão alguns exemplos das diversas telas criadas para os usuários. A tela disciplinas, teve duas versões que foram testadas posteriormente, o teste e os resultados estão na seção de validação.</p>
          
        <p class="title2">Interface Components</p>

        <p>As a foundation for creation, the front-end team used the open-source MUI library. Based on the listed components, visual adjustments were made to fit the brand’s own style. Iconography was also used according to the library after team consensus, as this reduced the amount of content to be loaded on the system server, prioritizing product performance.</p>

        <img src="../public/components.png" style="width: 100%;">

        <p class="title2">Final result</p>

        <p>The project required creating a tutoring system for student, tutor, professor, and coordinator users. Based on their needs and alignment with requirements, an online tutoring system was built in which each user has an important role. Due to the large amount of content, I will summarize the final result for student/tutor users only, but if you want, I can provide all system screens.</p>
        
        <p>As a student, the user can:</p>

        <img src="../public/1.png" style="width: 100%;">

        <p class="subt">View semester subjects and schedule directly from the main screen</p>
        
        <img src="../public/2.png" style="width: 100%;">

        <p class="subt">Click on a subject and schedule with a specific tutor</p>

        <img src="../public/3.png" style="width: 100%;">

        <p class="subt">View scheduled and pending appointments</p>

        <p>As a tutor, in addition to the functions above, the user can:</p>

        <img src="../public/4.png" style="width: 100%;">

        <p class="subt">Accept student requests</p>
        
        <img src="../public/5.png" style="width: 100%;">

        <p class="subt">Confirm completed appointments</p>
        
        <img src="../public/6.png" style="width: 100%;">

        <p class="subt">Set availability in the system</p>

        <h3><br>5. Validate</h3>
        
        <p>To reach the final result for components and key flows for student/tutor users, a usability test was conducted with the goal of validating, between two options, how easy the flow and interface components were to understand. The test focused on young people aged 18 to 25, frequent users of digital products, and current/former university students. The test used:<br>
          A script;<br>
          Um protótipo de alta fidelidade do sistema para ambas as opções;<br>
          A spreadsheet to track the test and tabulate scores;</p>

        <img src="../public/teste1.png" style="width: 100%;">

        <p>The test was conducted online, where I was able to observe the user interacting with the screen using Figma. After each task, the user assigned a score, and from that score it was possible to measure ease of use and understanding of components.</p>
        
          <div class="image">
            <img src="../public/metric.png" style="width: 50%">
          </div>

        <p>Based on translated scores, all tested interfaces met their objective. The main screen that presents two options had better performance in <strong>Interface 2.</strong></p>

        <img src="../public/results1.png" style="width: 100%;">

        <p>Finally, during the activities, it was possible to map the positive and negative points of each interface.</p>
        
        <img src="../public/results2.png" style="width: 100%;">

        <p>For clarity, the screens that were tested were the following:</p>
        
        <img src="../public/compar.png" style="width: 100%;">

        <p>This made it possible to learn some interesting points about the proposed interfaces:<br><br>
          A list of tutors for students requires more scanning time, which leads to fatigue during search;<br>
          Icons with hover text do not work well if the user does not understand what the icon means;<br>
          Information blocks help reading and comprehension;<br>
          A list of buttons can cause confusion about their function;</p>
